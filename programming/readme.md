   - **Focus**: Control flow, conditionals.

4. **Loops**
   - **Purpose**: Learn to use loops (for, while, etc.).
   - **Exercise**: Write a program that prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
   - **Focus**: Loops, iteration, algorithm basics.

### Level 2: Data Structures and Operations
These exercises introduce key data structures and involve slightly more complex logic.

5. **Arrays/Lists**
   - **Purpose**: Work with arrays or lists.
   - **Exercise**: Create a list of 5 numbers, calculate their sum and average, then print them.
   - **Focus**: Arrays, list manipulation.

6. **String Manipulation**
   - **Purpose**: Learn string operations like concatenation, substring, and searching.
   - **Exercise**: Write a function to reverse a string.
   - **Focus**: String manipulation, working with character data.

7. **Functions/Methods**
   - **Purpose**: Learn how to define and call functions.
   - **Exercise**: Write a function to check if a given number is prime.
   - **Focus**: Function declaration, recursion (optional).

8. **Dictionaries/Maps/Hash Tables**
   - **Purpose**: Introduce associative arrays or hash maps.
   - **Exercise**: Write a program that counts the frequency of each word in a given text.
   - **Focus**: Key-value structures, iterating over dictionaries.

### Level 3: Intermediate Concepts
These exercises start to involve more complex programming patterns and common tasks in languages.

9. **File I/O**
   - **Purpose**: Work with reading from and writing to files.
   - **Exercise**: Write a program that reads a file and prints the number of lines, words, and characters.
   - **Focus**: File handling, I/O streams.

10. **Classes and Objects (OOP)**
    - **Purpose**: Introduce object-oriented programming concepts.
    - **Exercise**: Define a `Person` class with properties like `name` and `age`, and create methods for greeting.
    - **Focus**: Classes, objects, encapsulation.

11. **Inheritance and Polymorphism (OOP)**
    - **Purpose**: Learn about inheritance and polymorphism.
    - **Exercise**: Extend the `Person` class with a `Student` class that adds a `studentID`, and override the greeting method.
    - **Focus**: Inheritance, method overriding, OOP principles.

12. **Exception Handling**
    - **Purpose**: Learn how to handle exceptions and errors.
    - **Exercise**: Modify a program that reads a file to gracefully handle file-not-found errors.
    - **Focus**: Exception handling, try-catch blocks.

### Level 4: Advanced Language Features
These exercises introduce more advanced language features and paradigms.

13. **Recursion**
    - **Purpose**: Work with recursive algorithms.
    - **Exercise**: Implement a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
    - **Focus**: Recursion, base cases, and recursive cases.

14. **Generics/Templating (if applicable)**
    - **Purpose**: Learn about generics or templating in strongly typed languages.
    - **Exercise**: Create a generic class or function that works with different data types, such as a generic list or stack.
    - **Focus**: Type safety, generics, reusability.

15. **Concurrency/Multithreading (if applicable)**
    - **Purpose**: Learn basic concurrency/multithreading constructs.
    - **Exercise**: Write a program that spawns multiple threads to calculate the sum of different sections of an array concurrently.
    - **Focus**: Multithreading, synchronization, parallelism.

### Level 5: Comprehensive Challenges
These exercises require a combination of skills learned from the previous exercises and are more complex.

16. **Data Processing Pipeline**
    - **Purpose**: Combine file I/O, data structures, and logic into a real-world task.
    - **Exercise**: Write a program that reads a CSV file, processes the data (e.g., calculating averages or sorting), and writes the results to another file.
    - **Focus**: End-to-end data processing, working with real-world data formats.

17. **Design a Small Application (CLI or GUI)**
    - **Purpose**: Build a small but functional application.
    - **Exercise**: Create a command-line calculator or a simple GUI application that lets users input data and see results.
    - **Focus**: Input handling, application design, interactivity.

18. **REST API Client**
    - **Purpose**: Learn to interact with web services and APIs.
    - **Exercise**: Write a program that consumes a public REST API (e.g., fetching weather data) and displays it in a structured format.
    - **Focus**: Networking, APIs, JSON/XML parsing.

19. **Unit Testing**
    - **Purpose**: Introduce testing frameworks and best practices.
    - **Exercise**: Write unit tests for one of the earlier programs (e.g., prime number checker).
    - **Focus**: Unit testing, mocking, test-driven development (TDD).

20. **Build a Simple MVC or CRUD Application (Advanced)**
